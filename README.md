# ERD.Designer
A tool for designing Entity Relationship diagrams and then populate database from them, for learning purposes.
I developed this tool using ASP.NET with C#, and SQL Server database.

You can use this tool for:
* Create new ERD diagram.
* Save diagram, and retreive it again.
* Modify previously saved diagram.
* Generate database from a diagram.
* Query a database (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

It populate only SQL SERVER database, but It can be modified easily to populate to more database types.
